/* This implements "lock-free" signalling of external semaphores where there is
 * no lock between the signal responder (the VM) and signal requestors, but
 * there may be spin-locking between signal requestors, depending on the implem-
 * entation of atomicAddConst.
 *
 * Freedom from locks is very helpful in making the QAudioPlugin function on
 * linux, where the absence of thread priorities for non-setuid programs means
 * we cannot run the QAudioPlugin's ticker in a separate thread and must instead
 * derive it from the interval-timer based signal-driven (software interrupt)
 * heartbeat.  If the external semaphore state is locked while the VM is
 * responding to external semaphore signal requests and the heartbeat interrupts
 * causing a locking request for an external semaphore signal request then the
 * system will deadlock, since the interrupt occurs in the VM thread.
 *
 * Lock freedom is achieved by having an array of request counters, and an array
 * of response counters, one per external semaphore index.  To request a signal
 * the requests are locked and the relevant request is incremented.  To respond
 * to a request the VM increments the corresponding response until it matches
 * the request, signalling the associated semaphore on each increment.
