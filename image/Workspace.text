This image is intended to build new CoInterpreter or StackInterpreter Cog VMs, and a Newspeak VM, and to run the Cog VM simulator (see the VM Simulation Workspace).The following doit offers a menu of configurations that create a single; source tree (../src) for all platforms.  Since they use a relative path they will work out of the box.  Generate the entire VM using them.  Choose Squeak Cog VM by default, and when prompted choose CoInterpreter.	VMMaker generateConfigurationTo rebuild this image- start with a Squeak 4.3 or newer image (this is a Squeak 4.3 trunk image that you can update).1. If Alien is not already in the image, load it, e.g.  Alien-eem.18 from http://www.squeaksource.com/Alien.2. If FFI is not already in the image, load FFI-Pools, e.g. FFI-Pools-eem.3, from http://source.squeak.org/FFI (For FFIConstants)[2a. Load FFI if you want to use cog:selector: to compile a method in this image]3. Load SharedPool-Speech, e.g. SharedPool-Speech-dtl.2, from http://www.squeaksource.com/Speech (For KlattResonatorIndices)4. Load Balloon-Engine-Pools (e.g. Balloon-Engine-Pools-JB.2) from http://source.squeak.org/VMMaker5. From    http://source.squeak.org/VMMakerload "VMMaker.oscog" and "Cog" monticello packages.  First load the most up-to-dateVMMaker.oscog, e.g. VMMaker.oscog-eem.157, and then the most up-to-date  Cog, e.g. Cog-eem.46.N.B. do *not* load VMMaker or VMMaker-oscog.N.B. VMMaker.oscog packages may be listed with VMMaker packages depending on Monticello version.
