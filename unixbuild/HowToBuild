Checking out sources
-------------------------------
To generate a VM check-out http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/image
which contains
http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/image/VMMaker-Squeak4.1.changes
http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/image/VMMaker-Squeak4.1.image
Start up VMMaker-Squeak4.1.image.  In it is a workspace containing a doit that
uses something like generate:and:to:platformDir:excluding:.  Doit.


How to build the Cog Croquet VM on Unix
-------------------------------
1. Install the tools (gcc, X11-devel, etc (e.g. libpng, libX11 & libxt source))
2. Check out the following sources from svn (if you haven't already - if you're
   reading this in unixbuild its likely you've already got the sources)
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/platforms
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/src
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/unixbuild
3. Open a shell, cd into the unixbuild/bld directory and execute
     ../../platforms/unix/config/configure --without-vm-display-fbdev --without-npsqueak CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -DNDEBUG -DITIMER_HEARTBEAT=1 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DCOGMTVM=0 -DDEBUGVM=0" LIBS=-lpthread
     make install prefix=WhereYouWantTheVmToGo

	N.B.  On Ubuntu *do not* supply "LIBS=-lpthread", i.e. use
     ../../platforms/unix/config/configure --without-vm-display-fbdev --without-npsqueak CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -DNDEBUG -DITIMER_HEARTBEAT=1 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DCOGMTVM=0 -DDEBUGVM=0"

4. At the end of it you'll get a new VM in the path provided via -prefix


3a. For an assert-enabled VM do
     ../../platforms/unix/config/configure --without-vm-display-fbdev --without-npsqueak CFLAGS="-g -O1 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -DITIMER_HEARTBEAT=1 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DCOGMTVM=0 -DDEBUGVM=0" LIBS=-lpthread

3b. For a full debug VM do
     ../../platforms/unix/config/configure --without-vm-display-fbdev --without-npsqueak CFLAGS="-g3 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -DITIMER_HEARTBEAT=1 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DCOGMTVM=0 -DDEBUGVM=1" LIBS=-lpthread

3c. For a multi-threaded VM open a shell and cd to the mtbld directory.  Then
   execute
     ../../platforms/unix/config/configure INTERP=cointerpmt --without-vm-display-fbdev --without-npsqueak CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -DNDEBUG -DCOGMTVM=1 -DDEBUGVM=0 -D_GNU_SOURCE -DITIMER_HEARTBEAT=1 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1" LIBS=-lpthread
     make squeakmt
     make installmt prefix=WhereYouWantTheVmToGo

N.B.  As of early 2010 the linux pthreads implementation doesn't appear to
provide a way of setting priorities for the default thread scheduling policy
SCHED_OTHER (unlike e.g. Mac OS X) and doesn't appear to allow changing the
policy to one that does (e.g. SCHED_RR).  So for now we use the itimer
scheme.  See platforms/unix/vm/sqUnixHeartbeat.c

3d. If you want to get the Cog VM simulator working you'll need to build the
BochsIA32Plugin/BochsIA32Plugin.xcodeproj project and to build that you'll
need to first build bochs.  First check-out the processor simulator source tree
containing Bochs:
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/processors
Then build using the following, which works on Mac OS and is hence unlikely to
work entirely on linux (no xcodebuild):
  $ cd ROOT/processors/IA32/bochs
  $ ./conf.COG
  $ ./makeem
  $ cd ROOT/macbuild/BochsIA32Plugin
  $ xcodebuild

3e. If you're building the VM on a 64-bit OS, you'll need a compiler which can
compile and link to 32-bit binaries. On most Linuxes the gcc-multilib package
provides the 32-bit compiler and the ia32-libs provides the 32-bit libraries.
You'll also have to add the -m32 switch to all gcc & g++ invocations.  The
easiest way to do this is to add CC="gcc -m32" & CXX="g++ -m32" to the configure
script:
     ../../platforms/unix/config/configure CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32" CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -DNDEBUG -DITIMER_HEARTBEAT=1 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DCOGMTVM=0" LIBS=-lpthread
To run a 32-bit VM on a 64-bit OS, you'll also need the 32-bit libraries
provided by the ia32-libs package.


Compiling in 32-bit mode on a 64-bit linux
-------------------------------
Follow 3d. above.  Also note that according to Paul DeBruicker the following
packages need to be installed to compile in 32-bt mode on 64-bit ubuntu.  YMMV.

lib32asound2-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
build-essential
ia32-libs
gcc-multilib
g++multilib


Testing an external plugin has completely linked
-------------------------------
You may find that an external plugin compiles and links but does not load.
This is usually because it contans undefined symbols.  To find undefined
symbols, remake the plugin, capturing the link step and then supply
	-Wl,--warn-unresolved-symbols -Wl,--no-allow-shlib-undefined
when manually repeating the link command


Optimization level and gcc version
----------------------------------
There appear to be issues with 3.4.x gcc version on RedHat.  In particular
compiling the Newspeak VM with either of
	gcc version 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-3)
	gcc version 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-10)
using -O2 results in a VM that segfaults early in startup.  For these compilers
it is probably wise to use -O1, even though -O3 seems to work.
