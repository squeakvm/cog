To generate a VM check-out http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/image

How to Build the Cog VM on Windows
----------------------------------
1. Install the tools:
- Install cygwin from www.cygwin.com.  As of writing the VM is built using
CYGWIN_NT-5.1 mcstalkerxp 1.5.24(0.156/4/2) 2007-01-31 10:57 i686 Cygwin
2. Check out the following sources from svn (if you haven't already - if you're
   reading this in cygwinbuild its likely you've already got the sources)
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/platforms
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/src
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/cygwinbuild
2a. If you want the whole kit and caboodle including the VMMaker image try e.g.
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog cogvm

3. Open a cygwin bash shell, cd into the cygbuild directory and execute
     make

   Caution: if you previously used the mingw gnutools approach, you probably
   have a path to that 2.x gcc in your Windows PATH.  Make sure that 'which gcc'
   evalautes to the cygwin gcc 3.4.x not the MinGW gcc 2.95.x (try gcc -v).

   Caution: if your default gcc is too recent (gcc-4), compilation may fail.
   In this case, you should rather use the following commmand
     make  CC=gcc-3 LD=gcc-3 DLLWRAP='dllwrap -mno-cygwin --driver-name gcc-3'
   
4. At the end of this process you should have a brand new Croquet VM in the
   cygwinbuild/build/vm folder (make sure you copy Croquet.map along with it)

3a. The cygwin makefile supports building three VM configurations, product,
    assert and debug, building product by default.  The configurations are
	product: stripped  & unstripped production VMs optimized at -O2 in
		build/vm/Croquet.exe
		build/vm/CroquetUnstripped.exe
	assert: an unstripped VM that includes assertion checks optimized at -O1 in
		buildast/vm/Croquet.exe
	debug: an unstripped, unoptimized VM that includs assertion checks
		builddbg/vm/Croquet.exe
    Note that even the stripped production VM can be used for debug using the
	unstripped VM to provide symbols, e.g.
		U:\ gdb bin/Croquet.exe
		...
		(no debugging symbols found)
		(gdb) file CroquetUnstripped.exe
		(gdb) run trunk.image

	In fact there is an additional VM alongside each Croquet VM, e.g.
		build/vm/CroquetConsole.exe
	This VM is a Windows "console" application which will run inside an MSDOS
	console window.  When the I/O code in 
		platforms/win32/plugins/FilePlugin/sqWin32FilePrims.c
	supports it this VM will be able to read and write to stdin and stdout.


3a. If you want to get the Cog VM simulator working you'll need to build the
BochsIA32Plugin/BochsIA32Plugin.xcodeproj project and to build that you'll
need to first build bochs.  WARNING: No one has tried to build the plugin on
Win32.  You are on your own but your efforts will be warmly welcomed.
First check-out the processor simulator source tree containing Bochs:
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/processors
Then build (on the Mac the following works)
  $ cd ROOT/processors/IA32/bochs
  $ ./conf.COG
  $ ./makeem
  $ cd ROOT/macbuild/BochsIA32Plugin
  $ xcodebuild
