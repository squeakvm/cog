Warning: The below is optimistic.  One probably has to build SqueakFFI using
winbuild for now.

How to Build the Cog VM on Windows
----------------------------------
1. Install the tools:
- Install cygwin from www.cygwin.com.  As of writing the VM is built using
CYGWIN_NT-5.1 mcstalkerxp 1.5.24(0.156/4/2) 2007-01-31 10:57 i686 Cygwin
2. Check out the following sources from svn (if you haven't already - if you're
   reading this in cygwinbuild its likely you've already got the sources)
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/platforms
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/src
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/cygwinbuild
3. Open a cygwin bash shell, cd into the cygbuild directory and execute
     make
4. At the end of this process you should have a brand new Croquet VM in the
   cygwinbuild/build/vm folder (make sure you transfer Squeak.map along with it)


Caution: if you previously used the mingw gnutools approach, you probably have
a path to that 2.x gcc in your Windows PATH.  Make sure that 'which gcc' in
cygwin is the cygwin gcc 3.4.x not the MinGW gcc 2.95.x (try gcc -v).
