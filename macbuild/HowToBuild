To generate a VM check-out http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/image

How to Build the Squeak Cog VM on Mac OS X
--------------------------------
1. Install the tools (xcode etc);  the CoreVM.xcodeproj is set-up to build
   using gcc 4.2 but you can optionally install the Intel C++ compiler 11.1
   and change the compilerSpec in CoreVM.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj to get
   better performance.

2. Check out the following sources from svn (if you haven't already - if you're
   reading this in macbuild its likely you've already got the sources)
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/platforms
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/src
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/macbuild

3. Open a shell, cd into ROOT/macbuild directory and execute either
     ./makevm
  or
     mvm -A
  mvm is a convenience wrapper around makevm that will build different versions
  (DeploymentSymbols, Debug, etc) and collect compiler output to log files.

3a. If you want to get the Cog VM simulator working you'll need to build the
BochsIA32Plugin/BochsIA32Plugin.xcodeproj project and to build that you'll
need to first build bochs.  First check-out the processor simulator source tree
containing Bochs:
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/processors
Then build the libraries macbochs/{cpu/libcpu.a,disasm/libdisasm.a,fpu/libfpu.a}
  $ cd ROOT/processors/IA32/macbochs
  $ ./conf.COG
  $ ../bochs/makeem
Then build the plugin:
  $ cd ROOT/macbuild/BochsIA32Plugin
  $ xcodebuild

4. At the end of this process you should have a brand new Croquet.app in the
   macbuild folder (or Fast.app Assert.app and Debug.app if you've used mvm).

N.B. The plugin set is defined by plugins.ext and plugins.int in the build dir.


Optimization level and gcc version
----------------------------------
There are issues with gcc version > 4.2.1.  Any of the following flags may break the build at -O2:
-ftree-pre
-fpartial-inlining
-fcaller-saves

So turn them off.  e.g.
     ../../platforms/unix/config/configure --without-npsqueak CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -fno-caller-saves -fno-partial-inlining -fno-tree-pre -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DNDEBUG -DITIMER_HEARTBEAT=1 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DCOGMTVM=0 -DDEBUGVM=0" LIBS=-lpthread

Clang
-----
So far Clang only works at -O1.  So it may also be subject to some of the same
issues as gcc.  Please report back successes with clang, especially at -O2.
